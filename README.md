# GoComputerScienceExamples
Computer science ideas written in go

I intend on updating this repository and a [python](https://github.com/NativeCognitive/PyComputerScienceExamples) repository as I learn computer science with the code representations as I learn

Currently I am using:
https://roadmap.sh/computer-science
and
https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university

I highly recommend checking those out, I am attempting to write the examples for anyone learning, including me
(why version control so confusing man)
